# This file allows configuration of randomizer when copied to a merged mod's root directory (the same directory with regulation.bin).
# Currently, this only supports configuration of ids added by other mods which cause significant errors or imbalance when they're randomized.
# Do *not* add vanilla key item locations here, as the run will softlock if any are required.
#
# Supported fields are as follows:
# NorandomEntities: Entity ids for enemies to ignore and not randomize
# NorandomLots: ItemLotParam_map entries to not randomize
# NorandomEnemyLots: ItemLotParam_enemy entries to not randomize
# NorandomLotFlags: Event flags in ItemLotParam where all lots with the flag should not be randomized (for shops, use the next field instead)
# NorandomShops: ShopLineupParam entries to not randomize
# When a lot/shop is not randomized, anything with the same event flag will also not be randomized.
# Note that if a higher priority mod overrides any of these params, this config will still be applied.
#
# For any id, first check randomizer spoiler logs (or the regulation.bin it makes) to see if it's already ignored.
# Randomizer will already ignore all item lots with non-vanilla event flags and all new enemies with non-vanilla entity ids.
# Otherwise, for any field, you can specify either numbers or ranges of numbers as a YAML list below (*without* the # in front):
#
# NorandomShops:
# - 1234500
# - 100945-100949
#
# Note that ranges are inclusive, so the above range includes both 100945 and 100949, but not 100950.
